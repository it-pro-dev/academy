# Welcome IT Pro's!

## Who are we?

We are a group of IT Pro's and developers that believe that the future of IT consists of a continuous collaboration between our 2 roles. We strive to eliminate the barriers that exist today and empower everyone involved in IT by promoting a mixed skillset suitable for DevOps.

## What are we trying to do achieve?

The US job market expects the demand for IT Pro's to increase by 4% the coming years. The demand for developers will increase by 30% in the same time.

The IT landscape is more & more focusing on the app and less & less on the server. As cloud platforms bring most economy with PaaS and SaaS technologies, the IaaS world like virtual machines, storage and systems management is rapidly becoming obsolete. We notice that a lot of IT Pro's with a great skillset are being locked-in and see their existing knowledge investments losing value. However, it are the same people that have a great potentional to become great DevOps engineers, developers and architect. It is all about using the knowledge you have and use it to understand new concepts and learn something new.

Our goal is to help IT Pro's in becoming acquainted with the cloud concepts & approaches and get the information they need to become profecient at operating an environment using DevOps technologies and processes.

## How will we achieve this?

We will provde several types of interaction to deliver the knowledge needed to go from a pure IT Pro role to a hybrid DevOps one:

We will periodically decribe simple scenario's:

* How to deliver an application as a set of Virtual Machines?

* How to deliver the same application using native Azure technologies?

* How to deliver the same application using containers?

For each scenario, we will:
* Describe the initial requirements and target outcome
* Very thoroughly describe the components that power the scenario and their relation to a traditional setup (eg Azure VM's vs Onprem VM's)
* Describe the tools used to deliver the scenario in the same manner. Automation, templating, scripting etc
* Combine the components and tooling to incrementally build up the DevOps solution untill we achieve the target outcome
* Post-scenario recap

We plan several types of interaction for each scenario:

* A set of learning articles including exercises and samples where applicable. The goal is to not let you spend more than 1 hour of time per week.
* Once we completed all articles for a scenario, we will provide a recording containing a walkthrough of the entire scenario from start to finish.
* A periodic live event will be held where we will provide the same scenario's as a guided lab, as well as having a Q&A / networking moment for those interested


We are not sure how far this will go and what the impact will be on the community. What we do know is that we want to help people to transform their careers and be ready for the next generation of IT.
